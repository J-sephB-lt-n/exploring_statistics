This French specialty is traditionally made with unpasteurized cream. However, this version is pasteurized and made in Vermont by Vermont Creamery. It is a rich treat that is perfect for thickening sauces and soups because it can be boiled without curdling. It is also delicious spooned over fresh fruit desserts. We especially like it served with our smoked salmon or with caviar. Just a dollop atop a piece of cocktail bread with a slice of smoked salmon lifts the experience to a whole new level. Its creamy tang is the perfect complement to a tender, smoky bite of salmon. Crme frache is the traditional accompaniment to caviar, and it smooths out the saltiness of the eggs.Vermont Crme Frache is exquisitely luscious, with a cultured flavor and creamy texture. Enjoy this staple of French cuisine, served by many of the world's finest restaurants.Awarded 2nd Place in the American Cheese Society 2007 Awards in the Cow's Milk Creme Fraiche category.KOF-K Certified Kosher.

Marlene Sandberg was appalled to learn that babies will produce half a ton of diapers every year. Half a ton! So she sought to create a range of award-winning diapers and baby products which are effective, price competitive, and --making Nature Babycare products good for both babies and the environment. We are the trusted source for  baby products among consumers and the green community. Nature Babycare is leading the industry in Europe by providing mum's with a high-performance diaper that is better for their babies and the environment.Why We're Award-WinningOur diapers and pull-on pants are over 60-percent biodegradable in contrast to major brands which are often composed of up to 80-percent oil-based products which do not decompose easily. Conventional diapers can take hundreds of years to decompose, but because of the high content of bio-degradable material, ours break down in a fraction of that time, meaning there's less need for landfill or polluting incineration. We keep oil-based plastics away from babies delicate skin and use natural, breathable corn-based materials instead. Our patented center-channel reduces the need for bulky absorbent material while enhancing leak protection. Nature Babycare Diapers are 100-percent chlorine-free, protecting the environment by not producing harmful dioxin pollution.All of this combined minimizes diaper rash and other irritations so that your baby is healthy and happy! With features such as stretchy tabs and leg gatherings, a soft cloth-like feel, and non-bulky absorbent pulp, we've created an award-winning diaper that performs ahead of the rest. Our founding principle was to give mum's a high performance diaper that is better for their baby and better for the environment. We strive to use renewable materials whenever possible in all of our product lines. Nature Babycare Diapers offer the convenience of disposables with the most  attributes.What Makes Us UniqueOther diapers can claim to be green but still use massive amounts of oil-based plastics. As a mum, our founder knew there had to be a better way to make diapers. That's why we've spent many years perfecting our diapers by eliminating as much non-biodegradable materials as possible while maintaining performance and comfort. We also use an absorbent pulp that is sustainably harvested out of Scandinavian forests. Our diapers are completely unbleached, contain no latex, fragrance, or TBT (tributyltin), and are hypo-allergenic.As with any diaper, for maximum performance, when your baby reaches the upper limits of the weight class, we recommend that you switch to the next larger size.Diaper Brand Comparison&nbsp;NaturebabycareChlorine-FreeDiaperStoreBrandsNationalBrandsNo oil-based plastic against the baby's skin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made from 60-percent+ natural biodegradable material&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patented Center-Channel that reduces the amount of absorbent polymers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certified by the world renowned Swedish Society for Nature Conservancy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soy-Based ink on diapers and packaging claim&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustainably Harvested Absorbent Pulp&nbsp;&nbsp;100-percent Totally Chlorine-Free&nbsp;&nbsp;Elastic Tabs and GatheringsAmazon.com and the manufacturer have teamed up to offer this item in Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging, a recyclable, easy-to-open alternative to traditional packaging.

Put five dice in a shaker, mix in strategy, add luck, stir--then let the fun begin! So how do you improve on something this good? By sprucing it up.  Yahtzee Deluxe is aglitter with sparking dice, a velvet-lined playing tray, a sturdy cushioned shaker that has the feel of soft leather, and detailed score cards that make totaling points easier than ever. The detailed instruction booklet even includes a section on the history of dice. The plush playing surface is set inside a light plastic frame that seems a trifle small, but this is a minor complaint.

It's played a bit like Candyland: You roll a die and  move your fossil playing piece over colored spaces. Progress around the  board coincides with the extraordinary evolution of dinosaurs that  roamed the planet as far back as 570 million years ago. As the animals  adapt and change, players can land on squares that advance their path  (\"Develop lungs. Swim ahead three spaces.\") or hold them back (\"Bitten  by Plesiosaurus. Paddle back two spaces.\"). When you land on a  creature, collect the matching creature cutout and place it on its  skeleton on your side of the board. The winning player is the first to  collect all nine of his or her allotted cutouts. (In more advanced  levels of the game, players have to answer questions about the dinosaur  before collecting the cutout.)--Tom Keogh Toys & Games\n",

Cathedral challenges two players to place as many buildings as possible within the  walls of a medieval city. There are two sets (light and dark) of hardwood buildings of various sizes. To  begin the game, one player places the cathedral on the grid of the walled city. Then the two players vie for  the remaining land. Their goal is to place their own buildings while thwarting their opponent's  land-grabbing tendencies. If a player can completely surround one of his/her opponent's buildings, that  building is removed from the board and the space gobbled up by a different building. The game ends up  resembling a puzzle that must be thoughtfully pieced together. The winner is the player whose unplaced  buildings would occupy the least amount of space in the city. Fans of chess should enjoy exercising their  strategizing muscles on this one. The hardwood board measures 9.25 inches square.--Wendy  Slotboom Toys & Games\n",

It sounds easy, but to accomplish your mission you have to first roll a five to even move off of start, and then you must avoid running into blockades and dodge your opponents, who threaten at every turn to send you back to the beginning. If you plot your moves strategically and use the safety zones scattered around the board, you might just make it.

      "                MATCHING DOCUMENT: Trouble Board Game Trouble is a board game with a simple concept: Be the first player to send your four game pieces all the way around the board, moving spaces determined by rolls of the dice. The \"trouble\" of the title comes when an opponent's piece lands on a space occupied by your piece, thus sending yours back to the beginning. Parents will likely remember the game from their youth, or at least remember the game's signature gimmick, the pop-o-matic dice roller. The Pop-o-matic is a dome-shaped clear plastic housing for the dice in the center of the board game that automatically tumbles the dice when pressed down and released. This feature, plus the board's plastic slots that hold the game pieces in place, make Trouble a perfect travel game--car or boat motion won't upset the game's progress. It is indeed satisfying to press, slap, or pound the pop-o-matic. It's strong enough to withstand the frustration of the losing player(s). The game's simplicity makes it easy to jump into without elaborate explanations or practice games for new players, but it's utter lack of strategy will likely limit interest to just a few rounds.--Porter B.

Using a collection of game booklets, each player (or  team) takes a turn at the spinner, then has to answer a \"Flashback\" question on  the decade that comes up. There are over 1,200 questions in the four books, and  the ease of answering them is based not just on one's knowledge of  entertainment, history, people, and pop culture, but in what decade you were  born. An intriguing \"point system\" allows players to give each other a series of  hints for each question, and what's truly unique about this game is the option  to tell a story based upon the subject of the question for a game point. The  result is an appealing mixture of trivia game and oral history, all in an  attractive sepia-toned package that's great for a family reunion or just an  informal evening of intergenerational nostalgia.--John Longenbaugh Toys & Games\n",

For a real challenge, go for a bonus Yahtzee--two or more in one game! This parlor classic has captivated and vexed players, young and old, since 1956.

The object is take four pawns from start to home, using rolls of the dice to dictate your moves. It sounds easy, but to accomplish your mission you have to first roll a five to even move off of start, and then you must avoid running into blockades and dodge your opponents, who threaten at every turn to send you back to the beginning. If you plot your moves strategically and use the safety zones scattered around the board, you might just make it. Parcheesi comes with a game board, 16 wooden pawns in four colors, two dice, and a dice cup that's a little too small to be truly useful. Parcheesi is for two to four players. Toys & Games\n",
